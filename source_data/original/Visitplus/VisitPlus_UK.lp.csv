The mountains were formed through violent volcanic eruptions, and then sculpted by massive glaciers. Fingal, the legendary Celtic hero, is said to have made his home among these towering mountains, while his poet son, Ossian, found inspiration in the landscape.

Towering out of the storm-tossed waters of the Atlantic Ocean, its cliffs and sea stacks clamour with the cries of hundreds of thousands of seabirds. 

Internationally recognised for its birdlife, St Kilda is no less famous for its human history. A community existed here for at least 4,000 years, exploiting the dense colonies of gannets, fulmars and puffins for food, feathers and oil.
The final 36 islanders were evacuated in 1930. Now uninhabited, visitors can brave the weather to sail to the ‘islands at the edge of the world’ for the experience of a lifetime.",Outdoors,,,57.813181,-8.571172,,
1700,Staffa,https://www.nts.org.uk/visit/places/staffa,National Trust for Scotland,"Volcanic rock columns are home to black guillemots, fulmars, puffins and the magical Fingal’s Cave Escape the everyday! This little island (½ mile long and ¼ mile wide) off the west coast of Scotland looks like it may be from a different planet. Its hexagonal columns were formed millions of years ago by volcanic eruptions and a vast blanket of lava that spread into the Atlantic Ocean. Years of waves crashing against these columns created the magnificent Fingal’s Cave. 
 Staffa was hardly known until 1772, when the botanist Joseph Banks highlighted the wild, natural beauty of the island. It soon became a must-see location. Famous visitors have included Queen Victoria, Lord Tennyson, Jules Verne, Robert Louis Stevenson and John Keats; all fell under the island’s spell. 
 Staffa came into the care of the National Trust for Scotland in 1986, a gift from John Elliott, Jr, of New York in honour of his wife Elly’s birthday. 
 Staffa was designated a National Nature Reserve in 2001. ",Outdoors,,,56.435675,-6.341803,,
1701,The Georgian House,https://www.nts.org.uk/visit/places/georgian-house,National Trust for Scotland,"Magnificently restored Edinburgh New Town house with fine collections of paintings, costumes and period furnishings The Georgian era produced some of Scotland’s most distinctive architecture. In the late 1700s, this grand townhouse was at the heart of Edinburgh’s New Town development. The house was designed by acclaimed architect Robert Adam and was a true statement of luxury in an era of enlightenment, for those who could afford it.
It cost the first owner John Lamont (18th Chief of the Clan Lamont) £1,800 in 1796. The house has been magnificently restored to show a typical Edinburgh New Town house of the late 18th and early 19th century. The fine collections of period furniture, porcelain, silver and glass reflect the Lamonts’ lifestyle, including lavish entertainment for guests, as well as the social and economic context of the time. 
Lamont also employed numerous servants. The kitchen and servants’ room give a glimpse of the arduous ‘below stairs’ life of the servants, who made the Lamonts’ elegant lifestyle possible. 
John Lamont died in 1816 in financial difficulties. His son, also John, sold the house for £3,000 a year later to Catherine Farquharson of Invercauld.",Homes & Work,,,55.95254,-3.207947,,

Douglas firs tower over the paths leading to the roaring Black Linn Falls, where the River Braan crashes down into the deep, foaming pools below. Overlooking the waterfall is the picturesque folly known as Ossian’s Hall, built in 1757 as the focal point in an extensive designed landscape. Decorated with mirrors, sliding panels and paintings, it has been refurbished to re-create the illusions of shock, surprise and amazement that were the aims of the folly’s original design.

The Hill House is considered to be Charles Rennie Mackintosh’s domestic masterpiece. Working to a commission from Glasgow book publisher Walter Blackie, up-and-coming architect Mackintosh and his wife Margaret created almost everything you see here, from the building itself to the furniture and textiles. 
Mackintosh was a revolutionary designer, but the materials and techniques at the cutting edge of architectural design in 1900 haven’t withstood a century of the west of Scotland’s harsh, wet weather conditions.
The external render of the property has not proved watertight and the walls have gradually become saturated and are crumbling, with water now threatening the interiors.
If we don’t act soon, the house will be irreparably damaged and we’ll lose its iconic architecture and unique interiors forever.
We’re embarking on a 10-year conservation programme, which will allow continued public access to the house, but also offer views of the Hill House that have never been seen before, even by Mackintosh himself. Stage one opened to visitors in early June 2019, with a protective steel frame structure covered in chainmail mesh, featuring walkways around and over the top of the house.

However, when you step inside, the faithfully restored four rooms appear as if frozen in time and provide a rare glimpse into life in Glasgow in the early 20th century. 
 Shorthand typist Miss Agnes Toward lived here from 1911 until 1965, and preserved her furniture and possessions with love and care. She held on to all sorts of things that most people would have thrown away, and this extensive personal archive has become a valuable time capsule for visitors today. The Tenement House also reveals what it meant to be an ‘independent woman’ at that time. ",Homes & Work,,,55.868097,-4.268369,,

 The unassuming exterior of this wee house in Ecclefechan, near Lockerbie, belies its significance in Scottish history. The house was constructed by Thomas Carlyle’s father and uncle – both local stonemasons – and is a fine example of Scottish 18th-century vernacular architecture. 
 When Thomas Carlyle was 13, he left Ecclefechan and walked 84 miles to Edinburgh, to attend the university.

Considered by many to embody the North Highland landscape of Scotland, Torridon is an ancient and enchanting wilderness of water and rock. The rugged mountains are incredibly old – the Torridonian sandstone that forms the bulk of all the mountains dates back 750 million years. On the west side of the estate the hilly and loch-strewn landscape is even older. Composed of Lewisian Gneiss, it’s over 2,600 million years old and it was the erosion of this land that provided the sediment, laid down in shallow seas, for the sandstone we know today.
Part of the Beinn Eighe National Nature Reserve is on the Torridon estate and, along with other designations, the estate supports an impressive variety of flora and fauna, including important plant colonies, rare mosses and lichens, and the elusive pine marten and golden eagle.
There’s an amazing choice of walking and climbing routes on the property, with over 18 miles of paths to choose from. Five of the Trust’s Munros are found here, including Liathach, peaking at 1,054m (3,456ft), and Beinn Alligin at 985m (3,230ft).",Outdoors,,,57.5441624,-5.5043601,,
